@2=~(With eager anticipation, you wait for Schael to arrive. You've made some preparations you think she'll enjoy, including buying a platter of the most delectable fresh fruits that the city has to offer, as well as a bottle of her favorite red â€” the dark wine from Berdusk. You've also taken the liberty of removing your armor and clothes.)~
@3=~(Having nothing better to do, you decide to pass the time by pleasuring yourself while remembering the first time that you and Schael made love. You make sure to avoid reaching a climax; every time you feel yourself get close to the edge, you stop and wait for your erection to subside before starting again. Minutes slowly turn to hours... maybe she isn't coming tonight after all. You pull up the covers around you as you begin to doze off... )~
@4=~(You hear a knock at the door, and what sounds like laughing. It must be her!)~
@5=~Come in!~
