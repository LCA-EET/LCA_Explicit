This mod patches <a href="https://github.com/LCA-EET/LCA">Love Conquers All</a> to add some sexually explicit dialogs and cutscenes, written from a male perspective. F/F content will be added at a later date. This mod is definitely not for everyone, especially those below 18 years of age, and I don't recommend it if any of the following kinks make you uncomfortable:

<br>
- Bondage / BDSM<br>
- Cuckolding<br>
- Dominance<br>
- Erotic Asphyxiation<br>
- Exhibitionism<br>
- Foot Fetishism<br>
- Humiliation<br>
- Masochism<br>
- Oral Stimulation<br>
- Quirofilia<br>
</details>
Writing this content is difficult for obvious reasons. Sexuality is deeply personal; I focused on a broad set of the most "mainstream" fetishes out there, so that there would be something for everyone to enjoy.
